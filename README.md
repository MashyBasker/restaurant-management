# RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### _What this does_

This is a program to display the menu for a restaurant based on the quantity of dishes sold in the past week and sort them accordingly using [Merge Sort](https://www.javatpoint.com/merge-sort).

The system asks the customer for their preference(Veg or Non-Veg) as [V/N]. The customer is also asked for their budget.

Using these input data, the program generates the optimized bill.

### _How it does it_

The program segregates the menu which was taken into a linked list from a `.csv` file into another list depending upon whether the customer chose vegetarian or non-vegetarian preference.

The optimised bill is generated using the [Knapsack Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/)

### _Challenges_

The first challenge we faced was taking the input from an `Excel`(first choice) file into a linked list. As we could not find any external library or discover any clever method to perform this task, we decided to use a `csv` file.

The second challenge was of implementing the Knapsack Algorithm and displaying the optimized bill.

### _Future of this project_

There is no future for this project. This is the end. Period.

No one will possibly ever use this product.
